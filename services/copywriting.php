				<h2>My story</h2>
				<p>I love learning and technology. I am flexible and honest. I love helping people with my skills.</p>
				<h2>How I started</h2>
				<p>I started learning about design and coding after my daughter was born. When she was born I stayed home to look after her and I used my free time to learn how to make video games. I learned about visual design theory and I learned how to program using C#.</p>
				<h2>The next step</h2>
				<p>After my son was born I decided I really enjoyed working on the computer but it’s hard to make an income in freelance game design. I started learning how to specifically design websites to build on my basic design skills as a way to do what I love and earn an income at the same time.</p>
				<h2>Finally there</h2>
				<p>At the end of 2017 I felt like my design and development skills were up to a professional level so I started to focus on developing more advanced web design skills like SEO, content creation, and marketing. Hopefully I will just keep improving my skills and helping people like you to have a beautiful and helpful web presence.</p>
