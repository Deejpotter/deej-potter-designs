					<h2>I love technology</h2>
					<p>I have always had a love for technology. Since I can remember I have been learning about every 
					electronic device I could get my hands on.</p>
					<p>I grew up with the internet so I have had a lot of time 
					to figure out how it works and I also love sharing my knowledge with other people. I’m always happy 
					to help someone who needs it and if I can practice my skills at the same time, even better.</p>

					<h2>I love learning</h2>
					<p>I completed a certificate in IT in 2013 but most of what I know about web design has been self-taught. 
					To be honest, the rules and practices change so often that any good web designer should be self-taught.</p>
					<p>I have also used online courses for the trickier stuff. Linkedin Learning has very professional content 
					and I would recommend it if you want to learn about business, technology, or design. </p>

					<h2>I love my family</h2>
					<p>My family is really important to me. I am married and I have 3 kids.</p>
					<p>My family is the main reason I wanted to start my own business, so I could spend more time with them. 
					If I have any spare time I enjoy making and playing video games as well as learning about science and philosophy.</p>
					<p>Although, most of the time when I’m not working I’m studying to make better websites because there is so much to learn.</p>

					<h2>I love helping people</h2>
					<p>If you want to know anything else about me just send me a message. I'd love to answer your questions.</p>
